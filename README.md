## Discovering *Discovery*

Welcome to my Gov 1005 final project Github repo! Here, you can find my experimentation with functions and data scraping in [data-scraping.Rmd](https://github.com/lukekolar/final-project-data-scraping/blob/master/data_scraping.Rmd) (including many plot and data drafts), as well as the completed [shiny app code](https://github.com/lukekolar/final-project-data-scraping/blob/master/discovering_discovery/app.R).
