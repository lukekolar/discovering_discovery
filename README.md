## Discovering *Discovery*

Welcome to my Gov 1005 final project Github repo! Here, you can find my experimentation with functions and data scraping in [data-scraping.Rmd](https://github.com/lukekolar/final-project-data-scraping/blob/master/data_scraping.Rmd) (including many plot and data drafts), as well as the completed [shiny app code](https://github.com/lukekolar/final-project-data-scraping/blob/master/discovering_discovery/app.R).

The data for this app is updated as of April 2020. *Discovery* was released on February 26<sup>th</sup>, 2001, months after the release of its first single, "One More Time," released on November 30<sup>th</sup> of the previous year. I expect to update the data on the album's twentieth anniversary.
